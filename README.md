# CAN-arbitration-
CAN arbitration is a communication protocol used in automotive. In a CAN network, multiple ECU share a common communication bus to exchange data. When two or more ECUs attempt to transmit data simultaneously a process called arbitration occurs to determine which message takes priority. This ensures efficient communication in multi-node CAN networks
